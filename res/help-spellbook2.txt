  Elemental Spells:

   > firebolt: *
       A simple, yet effective spell learnt by every elementalist
       recruit. Fling fire from your hands, but be careful that fire
       still burns if you get too close.

   > firestorm: **
       A more proficient elementalist can learn to harness the power
       of firebolt to take it to a higher level. Conjure fire throughout
       your whole body and engulf everything in the vicinity. The 
       results can be devastating, but also overwhelming.

   > frostbite: *
       The first spell taught to ice elementalists and one that is
       perhaps from effective than that learnt by the fire students.
       Cool your breath and project it towards a target, freezing them
       in their tracks.

   > blizzard: **
       With enough breath control, a talented ice elementalist can
       produce more than a single breath of cold air. With blizzard, it
       is possible to freeze and entire room in one go. But beware,
       there is no inherent protection against this ice.
