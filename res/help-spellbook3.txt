  Debuff Spells:

    > hypnotise:
      A careful series of particular words, spoken in a particular manner,
      can send everything that hears you into a deep hypnotic sleep. The
      more proficient you are at the spell, the longer they will sleep for

    > bewilderment:
      There is nothing hypnotic about bewilderment, a careful concentration
      of energy, unleashed in a single deafening shriek will cause 
      everything nearby to lose there senses and stumbling around in a 
      disorientated manner. The louder this becomes, the greater the effect.

    > disarm:
