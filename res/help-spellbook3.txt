  Debuff Spells:

    > hypnotise: *
      A careful series of particular words, spoken in a particular manner,
      can send everything that hears you into a deep hypnotic sleep. The
      more proficient you are at the spell, the longer they will sleep for.

    > bewilderment: *
      There is nothing hypnotic about bewilderment, a careful concentration
      of energy, unleashed in a single deafening shriek will cause 
      everything nearby to lose their senses and stumble around in a 
      disorientated manner. The louder this becomes, the greater the effect
      duration.

    > disarm: *
      This spell has a crippling effect on a target, drastically diminishing
      the physical strength they can exert.
