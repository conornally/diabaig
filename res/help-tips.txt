 Use lots of potions: 
   The dungeon provides you with a large number of powerful potions, many of
   these have adverse effects that will cripple dangerous creatures. It is a
   good idea to constantly have weapons coated with these potions, such you
   can efficiently inflict more creatures with these potions effects.

 Use spells as much a possible:
   Almost every spell gets more powerful with every use, additionally, some 
   can be "mastered", unlocking an evolved form. Mastery comes with a large 
   number uses. So use your spells as much as you can.

 Use the search function (s):
   Searching allows you to check items and creatures on adjacent tiles. 
   This lets you to identify certain disguised creatures like mimics, 
   illusions and vampires.

 Quick fire tips:
   Coating weapons with potions identifies the potion effect.
   Acidic Blobs cannot degrade mithril and non-metallic weapons/armour.
   Spell casting monsters drop "learn spell" scrolls.
