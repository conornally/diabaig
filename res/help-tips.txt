  Extend the use of potions by "applying" them to weapons. This triples the
    number of times you can impart the potion effect on a creature.

  Disguised creatures can be revealed by "searching" them, with (s) key

  Most spells increase in power with every use. Casting them liberally will
    help you become an unstoppable force in the dungeon

  Beware of chaining gas reactions: Flames ignites Miasma, Miasma mixes 
    with Mist, Mist extinguishes Flames. Additionally, Smoke suppresses all
    other gas types, this fact can be useful for controlling fires etc

  Unknown potions can be identified (without a scroll) by using them in 
    different ways. Applying them to weapons will safely (but wastefully)
    identify them in a tight spot 

  A pursuing creature will lose track of you after a while if it does not
    have direct line of sight. Disengage and flee to a corridor 
  
  Prevent freezing by wearing frost resistance rings, holding a torch or
    drinking a potion of dragonsbreath
  
  Auto Explore 'o' is a fast way to navigate the dungeon, but use it with
    care, the fast paced movement may get you into tricky situations
