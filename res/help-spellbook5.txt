  Enhanced Combat:

    > repel: *
      With a concentrated impulsive force, send a target flying backwards.
      If done so near a hard surface, they will be stunned for a short
      period. Increased usage strengthens this technique, increasing the
      knockback distance and stun duration.

    > shockwave: **
      An advanced repelling technique throwing all adjacent targets outward
      from the caster. This is useful for commanding space when one is
      overwhelmed by pursuers.

    > slice: *
      A large sweeping slice can be made, hitting three adjacent targets 
      simultaneously. 

    > twirling strike: **
      Advanced slice users can make a full rotation doing this maneuver.
      Striking targets on all eight adjacent tiles.

    > whirlwind: ***
      Unleash a flurry of pirouetting blade strikes, slicing adjacent
      targets several times. Best utilised when facing large numbers of 
      pursuers simultaneously.
