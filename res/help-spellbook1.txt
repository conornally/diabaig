  Protective Spells:

   > bandage wounds: *
       Apply restorative dressings to your injuries. This will cause 
       regeneration for a short amount of time. As you learn to use it, 
       the accumulative effect of regeneration will increase.

   > light heal: *
       Call forth for light in the darkness of Diabaig. This restores 
       a large percentage of your health in one go, the magnitude of 
       which increases with every use. 

   > holy heal: **
       Your calls have been heard by some higher power. You will receive 
       a temporary blessing, fully restoring your health, clearing all 
       negative ailments and continued regeneration for a period of time.

   > arcane barrier: *
       Using the defensive power of the arcane, you summon a barrier to
       protect your body. This will, for a period of time, greatly 
       increase your ability to withstand damage, from both physical
       and elemental effects. With increased usage, the length of time
       you can sustain the barrier increases. 

   > arcane absorption: **	
       Mastering the arcane barrier, your arcane shield blocks all 
       physical and elemental damage taken. The only toll taken is that
       on the barrier itself, reducing the length of time it can hold.
