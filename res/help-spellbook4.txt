  Support Spells:

    > pacify: *
      Concentrating energy within to enhance your own presence, intimidate 
      or "persuade" a pursuer to stand down. Acute pacifiers can increase 
      the duration of the effect.

    > polymorph: *
      A powerful but unpredictable transmutation spell. Users can morph a 
      target into an entirely new creature. However, even advanced users 
      are unable to polymorph the largest apex creatures in Diabaig.

    > grappling vines: *
      Learned by studying the druids, this spell makes use of basic 
      naturalist magic. Manipulate vegetation around the feet of a target 
      to result in a binding effect. They will no longer be capable of 
      moving around. As ones affinity with this spell increases, the 
      binding strength of the roots will too.

    > tangling mangrove: **
      Advanced naturalist magic users can encourage the instant growth 
      of vegetation in all nearby tiles, binding everything nearby to 
      the ground.
