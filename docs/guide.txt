# Items

Items can be found in the dungeon. Some of which are unidentifiable until used; these include potions, scrolls and mushrooms. To pick up an item, just walk over it and it will be appended to your inventory (if not full). Items can then be used, thrown 't', dropped 'D'.
Gold '*' is a special case item, once picked up it does not go into the inventory but counts towards your final score.

## Potions '!'

Potions are most likely to cause temporary status effects, some positive, others less so. To drink a potion 'd' and then select a potion in the inventory with 'a'-'z'. However you can also throw a potion at a monster to have the effect applied on them (if it makes contact). Additionally to gain the maximum amount out of a potion, you can apply 'a' it to a weapon, thus coating the e.g. dagger in poison - the next 3 targets hit with that weapon (incuding a thrown weapon) will have the potion applied to them.
Doing any one of these will cause the potion to become identified.

## Scrolls '?'

## Food ':'

You will get hungry in the dungeon. You will start the quest with a single piece of food but you will soon have to look for some. Mushrooms are the primary food source but will be unidentified at first. Mushrooms will satiate you however may cause certain effects, so consume them at your own risk.
