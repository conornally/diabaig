## Overview:

Back when tigers used to smoke, the Great Halls of Diabaig were home to a thriving civilisation. However, few records survived the ensuing fires when a dragon moved in. Descend to the depths of Diabaig, carefully navigate the twisting corridors and dangerous creatures and return with a tooth from the dragon's jaws.

Diabaig is a traditional ascii roguelike, with turn-based strategy, procedural dungeon generation and permadeath.
You will enter Diabaig, with the aim to retrieve a tooth from the jaws of the dragon on floor 30.
To get there, collect equipment, discover potions, magic scrolls and learn powerful spells, while trying not to get hurt by the numerous dangerous inhabitants.
But remember to keep enough supplies for the return journey!
